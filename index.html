  <h1>Choose your own HTMLventure</h1>
  <div id="adventure">

    <div class="pg" id="p-start">
      <p>
        You encounter a html document in a forest.
      </p>
      <p>It is affixed to a monstrous oak which sits as if deliberately placed in a fork between two paths.</p>
      <p>
        The layout of this document seems... unplanned. Almost like a desire trail in the metaphorical woods you find yourself in at this moment. 
        
      </p>
      <p>
        One path gives a strong feeling of a road not taken; a vision of HTML centred on communication from a human to humans. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The other path feels more like an actual history. Real, but impersonal and shaped by forces with (at best) a motive orthogonal to shared humanity.
      </p>
      <p>The document presents you with two links. It is up to you which path you take.</p>
      <div class="pg-choice">
        <ol>
          <li class="pg-opt">
            <a href="#p-1">Take the left path.</a>
            <p> Its corresponding link is a purest blue - 
              nobody has been down this in a long time.</p>
            <p>
              This path seems at once untouched, like it sprang fully formed with the world, 
              but on closer inspection it shows signs of <em>structure</em> and <em>intention</em>. Someone made this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="pg-opt">
            <a href="#p-3">Take the right path.</a>
            <p> This link is deep purple and the path well-worn.</p>
            <p>
              If you take this link, know you are just one among many. You sense that behind this door you will find frameworks.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pg" id="p-1">
      <p>
        You choose the left path. As the link turns purple you feel a certain peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not ten metres further, you see a new document. This is way cooler than the last one. It uses the latest in html technology to wow you with the full force of the Information Superhighway.
      </p>
      <marquee>It has marquees!</marquee>
      <blink>It would have had blink elements too if you looked at this on a browser that still supported it.</blink>
      <p style="color: red;">It even has colours.</p>
      <p>
        And the best part of it all - the content is self-describing. 
        The marquee block is about marquees, the blink block isn't working but if it did, the innerHTML would be about blinks. 
        The red block is about itself.
      </p>
      <div class="pg-choice">
        <ol>
          <li class="pg-opt">
            <a href="#pg-2">Walk further along the path, with a new appreciation for the power of Hypermedia.</a>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pg" id="p-2">
      You've been walking now for... hours? Minutes? You've lost all sense of time, communing with the spirits of the information age.
      <div class="pg-choice">
        <ol>
          <li class="pg-opt">
            <a>Do the first thing</a>
          </li>
          <li class="pg-opt">
            <a>Do the second thing</a>

    <div class="pg" id="p-3">
      <p>
        You head down the right path. 
        It turns out this path was a metaphor for React and corporate software development and now you can probably make a lot of money
        but your pages will just get slower and slower over time, and more laden with trackers and advertisements.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no going back. The whole web is like this now.

      This is the end.
